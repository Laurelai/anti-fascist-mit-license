This license may be used under the terms of the Anti-Fascist-MIT-License


FAQ.

This isnt free software!

Reply: No it is not. Thanks for noticing. It is free to a degree, so long as you are not a fascist.

Is this enforcable?

Reply: Im not a lawyer. However jslint's dont use this for evil licence is honored by multiple powerful corporations and evil is not defined in that licence in a specific way. Fascism is defined for the purposes of brevity and clarity in this licence. While there may be actual real world fascists who may not meet the specified criterea listed i believe this will cover most of them. Amendments to the licence will likely occur over time as these cases present themselves. Another thing to consider for enforcability is the case of Artifex v. Hancom. If you licence software with the antifascist MIT licence, and provide an option to buy a commercial licence it may be enforcable as a binding contract. Since you can refuse to do business with anyone without giving a reason it should not be hard to keep fascists from using your work.


Is this censorship?


Reply: No. I am not a government agency nor do i work for or represent any government agencies. I cannot violate your first amendment rights under the us constitution. I am a private citizen. This is a software licence. A contract between the software creator and its users. Businesses and people often enter into contracts that restrict behavior that the government would be unable to force someone into, and even in some cases (such as the us militarys ban on hate group membership and posessing hate group tattoos) they can do so.

Are you serious?

Reply: Absolutely.


What do the fascists think of this?

Reply: They mad. They super mad. Heres some shrieking from gab's CTO https://i.imgur.com/iMod3fC.png
